 Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop a robust image classification system capable of identifying various fashion items from grayscale images. The use of a Dilated CNN allows for an increased receptive field without a substantial increase in parameters, making it suitable for capturing both local and global features in images.

 Dataset

The system is trained on a fashion dataset containing grayscale images of different clothing items. The dataset is preprocessed to ensure compatibility with the model architecture.

Dataset Source: [Fashion MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist)

 Environment Setup

To run the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

 Model Architecture

The Dilated CNN architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers with dilated convolutions, allowing the network to capture features at different scales. The model is designed to learn hierarchical representations of fashion items.
